# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project Description

Group Members: Sindya Chinna Rajakumar, Warren Webb, Naishal Chauhan, and Entivenuka Naveen Kumar, and 
Project Name: SkySight
Project Aim: The aim of this app is to show the weather forcast in real time. It uses elements such a daily temperature, wind speed, humidity, a clock and a search bar. This gives the user an accurate depiction of temperature, windspeed and humidity in a particular city in real time.


### Use Cases

Daily Planning: Users often check weather forecasts to plan their daily activities such as commuting, outdoor events, or scheduling workouts. A weather app can provide hourly and daily forecasts, allowing users to plan their day accordingly.

Travel Planning: When users are planning a trip, they rely on weather forecasts to pack appropriate clothing and gear, choose the best time to travel, or decide on activities to do at their destination. A weather app can provide forecasts for specific locations, helping travelers make informed decisions.

Outdoor Activities: Whether it's hiking, biking, skiing, or simply going for a walk, outdoor enthusiasts use weather apps to check conditions such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and UV index to ensure safety and comfort during their activities.

Event Planning: Event organizers use weather forecasts to plan outdoor events such as weddings, concerts, festivals, or sports matches. Knowing the weather conditions in advance helps them make arrangements such as tent rentals, seating arrangements, or scheduling alternate dates if necessary.

### Strengths

Trust-worthy Real Time Weather Report

API Generated Data
Responsive User Interface


### Limitations
1. Current Weather Only: Provides only the current weather conditions, without forecasts.
2. Lack of Search Suggestions: Currently lacks a search suggestion or autocomplete feature, which can lead to challenges in accurately selecting locations with similar or identical names. This limitation can affect user experience, especially in pinpointing exact locations for weather information.
3. Limited Error Handling: Basic error handling for invalid city searches, with potential for more sophisticated user feedback.
4. API Dependency: Relies on external API for weather data, which could affect reliability and availability.


### Future Development

1. Weather Forecast: Integrate weather forecast functionality to provide future weather conditions.
2. Search Suggestions: Implement an autocomplete feature for the search functionality to provide suggestions as the user types. This will help in accurately selecting locations, especially beneficial for cities with identical names, ensuring users find the correct location easily.
3. Localization and Internationalization: Support for multiple languages and measurement units (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
4. Advanced Error Handling: Implement more advanced error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
5. UI Enhancements: Further enhance the user interface and user experience with animations and transitions.
